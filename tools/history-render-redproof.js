/**
 * Red proof for the thread drawing a chat's stored messages.
 *
 * Measured on the live account: the note-to-self chat held thirty-odd stored
 * messages and the thread drew one of them. The store was right - the read
 * returned every one of them, and the thread drew all of them when they were
 * handed to it directly - so the loss was between the store and the screen.
 *
 * A check that has never been seen to fail is not evidence of anything. This
 * reintroduces the loss one way at a time and asserts that the NAMED check
 * fails. A mutation that leaves the check green is reported as a hole.
 *
 * The last one is the other direction: a neutral rewrite that must stay green.
 *
 * Every file is restored in a finally, verified by content hash.
 *
 * Run with: node tools/history-render-redproof.js
